# Hints

## 1. Define rank & file range

- You need to define two [constant][constants] that should hold a [range][range] of ranks and files.
- The ranks should be an [`Int`][int] range from 1 to 8.
- The files should be a [`String`][characters] range from 'A' to 'H'.

## 2. Check if square is valid

- You need to check if a value is within a range.
- There is [a method][contains] that can be used to check if a value is within a range. 

## 3. Create move message

- You can use already defined methods to check if the move is valid.
